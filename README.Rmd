## Computer requirements

You need to have a recent version of [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed with [R](https://cran.r-project.org) >= 3.5.1 and the following packages installed:

### Basic packages for R extensions

```{r other packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("aricode")
install.packages("Matrix")
```

### Packages for graph manipulation

```{r graph packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("igraph")
install.packages("sna")
install.packages("network")
```

### Packages for stochastic block models

```{r SBM packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("blockmodels")
install.packages("mixer") ## you must install from source
```

### Packages for fancy plotting

```{r tidy packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggraph")
```

## Evaluation and Projects: extension of the stochastic block model

  - *Projects are here*: [subjects](https://github.com/jchiquet/CourseStatNetwork/raw/master/projects/projects.pdf)

Subjects of the projects will be discussed on the 22th of November. 

Evaluation of the module will be made based on 1) a report (less than 10 pages in English) and 2) A 15 talks presenting your project and 3) the reports sent at the end of each tutorial.
